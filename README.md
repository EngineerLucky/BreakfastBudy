BreakfastBuddy is a system designed to help small canteen businesses efficiently manage their customer transactions, whether they are cash or credit. The application allows business owners to record customer details, track purchases, update credit information, and generate monthly earnings reports. This tool aims to simplify the management of daily sales and outstanding credits, ensuring that canteen owners have clear visibility over their financial activities.

The system comprises a React.js frontend for user interaction, a Node.js backend with Express.js for handling API requests and business logic, and a PostgreSQL database for storing customer and transaction data. Key features include adding and updating customer information, recording transactions, updating credit amounts, and generating monthly reports. The system also provides notifications when a customer's credit exceeds a certain limit, helping manage credit risk effectively.

To get started, clone the BreakfastBuddy repository from GitHub, set up the backend and frontend environments, and configure the PostgreSQL database. Follow the installation steps to run the application locally. Contributions are welcomeâ€”please fork the repository and submit pull requests with your enhancements.
